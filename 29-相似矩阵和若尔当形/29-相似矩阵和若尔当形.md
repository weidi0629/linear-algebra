-- where positive definite matrix comes from
  - A^T A - least quare 
    - now A m*n - A^T A is square, symmatric 
    - x^T A^T A x = (Ax)^T(Ax) = |Ax|^2 >= 0 , if rank n -> no null space vaector -> pos def 
  - inverse of A is also pd, (eigenvalue is 1/λ)

-- similar matrix
- A and B simiar, m*n not symmatirc 
  - simialr means, for some M, B = M^-1 A M 
    - S^-1 A S = Λ -> A is similar to its Λ
    - set up a family, Λ is the most special one 
    - if A and B are simiar, A and B have same eigenvalues !!! 
    - eigenvector of b is M^-1 (eigenvector of A)
    
-- bad case: eigenvalues are same
    - λ1 = λ2 =4
    - there are two family, [[4,0];[04]] is lonely, M * [[4,0];[04]] * M = [[4,0];[04]] 不变
    - another is  [[4,1];[04]]  - jordan form 
-- jordan block
  - one eigenvalue on diagnal, and 1 above 
  - every square A is similar to a Jordan matrix J, J - with jordan block, # of block = # of eigenvalue 
  - good case - j is Λ
