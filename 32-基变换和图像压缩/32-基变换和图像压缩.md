x 属于 R^n   n = 512 *512
-- compressed 
  - change of basis 
  - better basis [1.1.....1] one vector give complete solid image 
    [ 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ]
    [1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 ... ]
   - JEPG isuing  Fourier basis 8*8 - take 8*8 block 
   SIGNAL X -> change basis -> coefficients -> compression (lossy) c^(many zeros) -> x^ = sum c^ v 
-- video
  - sequence of images 
  - wavelets
  
  问题转化为 P = W C  => C =  W^-1 P 
  GOOD BASISI
  - fast FFT
  - few is enough, few baisis vector is close to original singal 
  
  -- change of basis 
  - cols of W = new basis bectors 
    [x] old ori -> [c] new ori 
  - there is a transformation T
    - respect to v1 .. v8, it has matrix A
    - respect to w1 .. w8, it has matrix B
      A and B are similar 
  - SIMILAR
    - B = M^-1 A M , M is the changing basis matrix 
  what is A ?
  know T completely from T(v1) ... T(vn)
  because every x = c1v1 +... c8v8 
  then T(x) = c1T(v1) + ... c8T(v8)
