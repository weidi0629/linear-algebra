2-side inverse 
  A A^-1 = I = A^-1A  r = m =n full rank
left inverse 
  full col rank r=n, null ={0} <-> independent col, 0 or 1 solution to Ax =b
  A^t*A, its rank is also n invertible -> (A^t*A)A^T left inverse -> (A^t*A)A^T *A = I
  retangular matrix only have one-side inverse
right inverse
  rull rank r=m<n null ={0} <-> independent row, 无穷solution to Ax =b
  A*A^T(A^t*A) * = I 
如果left inver时，把A乘在左边得到 
  A(A^t*A)A^T  = p , project on the col space, 可以看成想inverse，但是只inverse了一半。

pseudo-inverse (when there is no full rank)
- when you multiply it, u won't get the identity though, but you got a project into row/col space and wipe out the null space.
- if x ！= y in the rwo space, then Ax != Ay, but they are all in the col space, one to one relation 
- x 到 y方向是A ， 反过来就是pseudo-inverse A 
 
 find pseudo inverse A+
 - 1 start from SVD 
   A = U ∑ V^T  
   A+ = V ∑+ U^T
